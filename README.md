## WELCOME TESTERS!

To test this unpublished plugin, simply create a schema. Then hook the plugin to it. The plugin options are:

- keySize --- Size of your key, defaults to 256
- keySalt --- salt for key generation, defaults to some lame value
- seed --- seed for creating the initial value hash, defaults to some extremely lame value.
- encoding --- encoding for the ciphertext, defaults to Hex. Can be Base64, Utf8, Utf16, or Hex.
- length --- length of the initial value, defautls to 512

Mocha and Chai are ready to be served by me your faithful barista. Or you can forgo testing frameworsk and do it old style. You're the tester!
